description:
    This package contains libraries for dealing with system processes.

    The typed-process package is a more recent take on a process API,
    which uses this package internally. It features better binary
    support, easier concurrency, and a more composable API. You can
    read more about it at
    <https://github.com/fpco/typed-process/#readme>.
